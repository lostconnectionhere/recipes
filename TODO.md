# Assignment 1

`seed_db.py` creates entries in the database.

Now I want to be able to navigate through this database using an interactive python terminal.

I want this menu: 

```sh
What would you like to do:
[1]: list recipes
[2]: list ingredients
[3]: add ingredient #next: check whether ingredient existst already 
```

After typing `1` this should say: 

```sh
Which recipe would you like to see:
[1]: <auto generated>
[2]: <auto generated>
[3]: <auto generated>
```

After typeing `2` it should show the full ingredient list of that recipe
```sh
Recipe `XX` is: 
<auto generated stuff>
```
